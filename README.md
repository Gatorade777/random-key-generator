This is my first project, and the idea is to create a key generator that can be integrated into a Linux program like a key manager. Currently, I use Bitwarden to store my keys.
Keep in mind:

    I'm a new programmer, and this is my first project, so I might make some mistakes. The purpose of this repository is to learn and keep evidence of my progress.

    I'm not completely sure how to complete this project, so it's not finished yetâ€”this is just the first version.

    I know I have a lot of grammar mistakes because I'm not a native English speaker. I'm learning programming and using this repository as part of that journey.

    If you have any suggestions or resources to help me complete this project, I would really appreciate it!
Here's how the code works when you run it:
